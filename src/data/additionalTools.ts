    directAnswer: 'Toolora Rotate Image is a dedicated, fast image rotator built to rotate image online and rotate photo online directly in your browser. It supports precise orthogonal turns: rotate picture 90 degrees clockwise (Right 90°), counter-clockwise (Left 90° / 270°), or 180° upside down. When you rotate JPG, rotate PNG, or WebP pictures by 90° or 270°, the tool automatically transposes the canvas width and height so the output picture matches its upright orientation without cropping or border distortion. Rotation is distinct from mirroring: rotation turns pixels radially around a center point, whereas flipping reflects pixels across an axis. If you need to fix a backwards selfie, use our [Flip Image](/tools/flip-image) mirror tool; if you need to convert formats after rotating, use [JPG to PNG](/tools/jpg-to-png) or [PNG to JPG](/tools/png-to-jpg); for resizing your upright pictures without quality loss, consult our [Image Resize Guide](/guides/how-to-resize-an-image-without-losing-quality) or use [Image Resizer](/tools/image-resizer).',

    directAnswer: 'Toolora Image DPI Checker is an in-browser photo resolution checker and image print size calculator designed for photographers, graphic designers, and print publishers. It reads an image’s native raster pixel dimensions and calculates the exact physical print dimensions achievable in both inches and centimeters across three standard print resolutions: 300 DPI (commercial photographic lab quality), 150 DPI (brochures, flyers, and medium-format posters), and 72 DPI (screen graphics). Crucially, DPI (dots per inch) is a print density relationship (Print Size = Pixels ÷ DPI), not a measure of stored data: changing or re-tagging DPI metadata in a file header does not invent new pixels or create optical detail. To check file container properties such as byte size, MIME type, and color depth, use our [Image Metadata Viewer](/tools/image-metadata-viewer); to scale pixel dimensions, use [Image Resizer](/tools/image-resizer); for standardized 2×2 inch or 35×45 mm biometric visa photos, use [Passport Photo Resizer](/tools/passport-photo-resizer).',

      title: 'Determining Maximum Sharp Print Size for a 2400 × 1600 Pixel Photo',
      scenario: 'A photographer wants to print a 2400 × 1600 pixel digital photo for a gallery frame and needs to know if it will remain sharp at 8 × 10 inches or 11 × 14 inches.',
      action: 'Upload the photo into [Image DPI Checker](/tools/image-dpi-checker) and inspect the 300 DPI calculation card.',
      result: 'The tool shows that at 300 DPI, the maximum crisp photographic print size is exactly 8.0" × 5.3" (20.3 × 13.5 cm). Printing at 11 × 14 inches would drop density to ~145 DPI (causing noticeable softness), confirming that an 8 × 10 crop or a 5 × 7 print is required for lab-grade sharpness.',

    faq: [
      {
        question: 'What is the formula for calculating print size from pixel dimensions?',
        answer: 'Print Width (inches) = Pixel Width ÷ DPI, and Print Height (inches) = Pixel Height ÷ DPI. To convert inches to centimeters, multiply the inch dimensions by 2.54. For example, a 3000 × 2400 pixel image printed at 300 DPI yields a 10.0" × 8.0" (25.4 × 20.3 cm) photo.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Does changing image DPI to 300 make a photo higher quality?',
        answer: 'No. DPI is simply a print density instruction (how many pixels are printed per inch of paper). Changing a file’s DPI metadata from 72 to 300 without increasing its pixel dimensions does not add detail; it merely tells a printer to print the existing pixels closer together into a smaller physical size.',

        answer: '300 DPI is the universal benchmark for photo lab prints, magazine publications, and fine art books. 150 DPI is acceptable for posters and banners viewed from several feet away, while 72 DPI is standard for screen displays.',
